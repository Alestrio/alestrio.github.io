**Passion and curiosity, two words that describe my lifestyle**.
----


Native of the **Ardennes**, I have always been very curious about the world of science. This led me to discover the digital world and **programming** at a young age. My first language, the one that made me discover algorithms and the way to code, is **Java**.

In a high school in Sedan, I obtained a baccalaureate S - Engineering Sciences, which allowed me to satisfy my technical curiosity, through the teaching of **mechanics, electrical engineering and computing**.

I then studied networks and telecommunication sciences at the IUT of Châlons-en-Champagne. \
I was able to acquire a lot of **network** skills, from basic architectures to operator networks (MPLS, BGP, MP-BGP, VPN-MPLS). \
I also acquired **programming** skills, highly system-oriented (Python, Powershell...), but also **modern-application-oriented**, with APIs programming (Python). \
In addition to these skills, there are **system** skills, through the expertise of various services (NGINX, Bind9, Apache, PostgreSQL...) but also of various **technologies**, such as **containerization**, **virtualization**, and **supervision**. \
Finally, I have acquired some digital signal processing tools, and some electronics notions.

This year, I joined the **UTC**, an engineering school in Compiègne, in order to improve myself in my system and artificial intelligence skills.

I am interested in cryptocurrency and **blockchain**, and I think that the applications we have today are very small, compared to the huge potential of this technology.

In order to share my **discoveries** and my adventures in the digital world, I run this blog, which also serves as my personal website.

This website is one of my **personal projects**. It is not powered by HTML, but by **Markdown** and uses system and DevOps skills!

To discover these personal projects, you can follow me on **GitHub** : [Alestrio](https://github.com/alestrio)
