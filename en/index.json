[{"categories":null,"contents":"As a Computer Science Engineering student, I recently had to complete an exercise involving assembly programming on Linux. To make my workflow as efficient and productive as possible, I set up a low-level C and assembly development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). The goal, was to be able to edit assembly code, but also run and debug it as if I was programming on Windows.","date":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.alexislebel.fr/en/blog/wsl_vscode_dev_environment/","tags":["VSCode","WSL2","MobaXTerm","Assembly","C","Makefile"],"title":"Low Level C and Assembly development environment with VSCode and WSL2"},{"categories":null,"contents":"A VPN is a tunnel that is completely opaque to the outside world and allows two distinct physical networks to be joined.

Native of the Ardennes, I have always been very curious about the world of science. This led me to discover the digital world and programming at a young age. My first language, the one that made me discover algorithms and the way to code, is Java.\nIn a high school in Sedan, I obtained a baccalaureate S - Engineering Sciences, which allowed me to satisfy my technical curiosity, through the teaching of mechanics, electrical engineering and computing.","date":"2022-04-13T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://www.alexislebel.fr/en/page/about/","tags":null,"title":"About me"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The French electronic notepad Introduction It will be nearly two years that I am in university studies at the IUT of Châlons-en-Champagne.
